THIS IS THE PROMPT FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT

You are to use Linked Lists to do this Program.

The XYZ Widget store receives shipments of widgets at various costs. The store’s policy is to charge a 30% markup, and to sell widgets which were received earlier before widgets which were received later. This is called a FIFO policy.

Write a program using linked lists that reads in three types of input data and does the following:

A sales record which contains an “S” in column 1 and a quantity  which represents the number of Widgets sold 

A receipt record which contains an “R” in column 1 and a quantity and a price which represent the receipt of a quantity of widgets at the stated cost per widget.

A promotion card  which contains a “P” in column 1 and a number such as 25 which would represent a 25% discount to the next 2 buying customers (the next 2 sales cards )  

The program should

Print a message after each receipt record is read in with the price of the widgets received.

Print a message after each promotion card is read in with the amount of discount the next to customers will be receiving.

After a sales record is read in print a message stating the number sold and the price of each widget and total price of the order. For example if 200 widgets were sold and there were 50 widgets at $1.00 and 100 at $2.00 and 50 at $3.00 print (recall the 30% markup and the FIFO policy)

	200 Widgets sold 
	50   at  1.30 each 	Sales:  $   65.00
	100 at  2.60 each	Sales:  $ 260.00   
	50   at  3.90 each 	Sales:  $ 195.00
			Total Sale:    $ 520.00 

If there are an insufficient number of widgets in stock to fill an order sell as many as are available and then print 

“ Remainder   of  xxx   Widgets not available”

Do not forget the promotional discount.

At the end of the data before exiting the program print out under a separate heading the widgets still left in stock and their original purchase price.
